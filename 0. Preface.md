# Preface
This guide aims to be an introduction to conceptual mathematics for non mathematicians.
It is structured in a way, in which at first the vocabulary is defined, if not otherwise stated.
Second, concept is explained.
Third, a short summary is provided.

This process is repeated until the knowledge is acquired to understand an example of a Category.
If something is unclear, please open an issue or email me.
I would be delighted if you contribute :)
