## Vocabulary 

### Abstract Object

### Mathematical Object

### Axiom

### Collection

### Definable
It means that all sets which has a property which we can describe in the given language.

### Class
classes are definable collections of sets.

### Set

### Difference between sets and classes
the difference between sets and classes is that sets are elements of other sets. Classes are not elements of any other class, so if A∈B then A is a set.

### Map

### associativ
f : a → b, g : b → c and h : c → d then h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f

### identity
1x ∘ f = f and g ∘ 1x = g.

### composition

## The Concept
You can imagine Category Theory as an abstraction on top of Mathematics.
It was created to better understand and prove concepts.
common language to almost all of mathematics.

### Category
A category has a class ob(C) of objects.
And a class hom(C) of morphisms or arrows between these objects.
Categories are simultaneously homes to mathematical objects and mathematical objects in their own right.

### Morphisms
A morphism is a more abstract structure-preserving map or function. It has a source object a and a target object b.
It has to hold the following rules, which we call axioms:
- associativity
- identity
for every three objects there is a composition of morphisms, f : a → b and g : b → c is written as g ∘ f or gf. g(f(a)).

### Functors
So there should be morphisms between categories too. They are called Functors. Which are in some sense structure structure-preserving, too.

### Natural Transformation
A morphism between Functors is called Natural Transformation
natural Transformation have to satisfy these axioms:
1. The natural transformation must associate to every object X in C a morphism ηX : F(X) → G(X) between objects of D. The morphism ηX is called the component of η at X.
2. Components must be such that for every morphism f : X → Y in C we have:
$$
\eta_Y \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \eta_X
$$
